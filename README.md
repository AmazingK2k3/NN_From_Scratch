# NN_From_Scratch

This project is currently under development and aims to create a neural network for classification and regression tasks using only numpy and Python. It is inspired by the sentdex course, but additional features are planned to be added.

## Overview
The `nn.py` file contains the implementation of the neural network from scratch. It utilizes various functions and techniques to train and evaluate the network on different datasets.

## Features (under works)
- Classification: The neural network is capable of performing classification tasks, where it can predict the class labels of input samples.
- Regression: The neural network also supports regression tasks, allowing it to predict continuous values based on input features.
- Numpy and Python: The implementation relies solely on numpy and Python, making it lightweight and easy to understand.


Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and more features will be added in the future.
